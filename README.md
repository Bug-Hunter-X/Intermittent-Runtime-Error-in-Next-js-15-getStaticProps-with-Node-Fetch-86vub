# Intermittent Runtime Error in Next.js 15 getStaticProps with Node Fetch

This repository demonstrates an intermittent runtime error encountered when using `node-fetch` within the `getStaticProps` function of a Next.js 15 application.  The error is not consistently reproducible, making debugging challenging.

## Bug Description

A Next.js 15 application utilizing `node-fetch` within `getStaticProps` to retrieve data from an external API intermittently throws a runtime error. The error doesn't occur every time the page is built or rendered; it's sporadic and difficult to pin down.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about`. The error may or may not occur. Refreshing the page multiple times might eventually trigger the issue.

## Potential Causes

Several factors could contribute to this intermittent behavior:

* **Network issues:** Temporary network instability between the Next.js server and the external API.
* **API limitations:** Rate limiting or temporary outages on the API side.
* **Next.js internal inconsistencies:** Although less likely, there could be rare edge cases within Next.js's build process or runtime that interact unpredictably with asynchronous operations.

## Solution

The provided solution includes improved error handling and improved retry logic to address the intermittent error, making the application more robust.
